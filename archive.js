I was entering my third year of collaboration with the organization, and the team was looking for ways to adapt the classic show-centric key art into something more unified and flexible. We didnât know what the summer was going to consist of, but we knew it was going to be outdoors and unlike past seasons.</p><p>My visual direction embraced two challenges necessitated by COVID safety protocols: the need to hold shows outside, and the need for more digital materials. This manifested in an overarching identity showcasing the performance locations, as well as a digital program website uniting the production credits under one umbrella.</p><p>The seasonâs specific programming was very much in flux when we began drafting key art and titles. To start, I explored minimalistic designs featuring a central object and distinct color for each production. At this point in the design process, the team began using a consistent naming scheme for referring to the three planned productions, with each showâs title utilizing the word âOutsideâ followed by the showâs performance location. As the shows gradually took shape, we ended up moving away from the object-centric design style in favor of key art that depicted the performance locations. The resulting branding was more neutral and upbeat in tone.</p><p>In 2020, Williamstown and I explored a new program concept in which I designed and developed a <a href='/work/season-on-audible/'>custom website</a> to host show credits.

My monogram is now the official design used by the university across all official communications and merchandise.</p>","links":[["Read the official announcement on Wesleyanâs blog","https://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2019/03/06/monogram/"]],"tags":"logo","year":2019,"sort-chrono":"2019-03-07","sort-custom":3,"sort-alpha":"monogram","thumbnail":{"format":"image","image":"wes-monogram.jpg","alt":"Monogram for Wesleyan University"},"assets":[{"format":"image","image":"wes-monogram-final.png","alt":"Final design"},{"format":"image","image":"wes-monogram-proposal.png","alt":"Original proposal"},{"format":"image","image":"wes-monogram-publicity.jpg","alt":"Publicity photoshoot"},{"format":"image","image":"wes-monogram-merch.jpg","alt":"Official merchandise featuring the monogram"}],"color":"#D72121","invert":true,"active":true},"kerfed-wood-sculpture":{"key":"kerfed-wood-sculpture","title":"Kerfed Wood Sculpture","subtitle":"","tagline":"Fabricated sculpture made of laser-cut plywood.","desc":"<p>In my final year at Wesleyan University, I took a course in digital fabrication taught by Elijah Huges.

For the thesisâ performance component, I devised a piece that used nineteen speakers in lieu of actors to investigate the role of technology in a performance context. I dubbed this piece a âsound performance,â which materialized as an immersive experience guided by limited, ambiguous narrated instructions. A pre-recorded voice led a small audience through various activities and spaces under the false premise that the audienceâs behavior affected what sounds or instructions would occur. Of the ten performances, no two were the same.</p><p><strong>Director/Sound Designer:</strong> Gabriel Drozdov<br><strong>Stage Manager:</strong> Drew Weiss<br><strong>Scenic Designer:</strong> Ava Calabrese Grob<br><strong>Properties Designer:</strong> Capri Gehred-OâConnell<br><strong>Narrator:</strong> Maddie Ulevich<br><strong>Stagehand:</strong> Nika Litt<br><strong>Publicist: Ramsay Burgess</strong><br><strong>Production Manager:</strong> Rebecca Foster<br><strong>Thesis Tutor:</strong> Calvin OâMalley Anderson<br><strong>Technical Advisor:</strong> Tony Hernandez</p><p><strong>Part 1: Sitting, Waiting</strong><br>Each performance began with the audience entering a small area enclosed by curtains. Narrated audio from two speakers initiated the show by providing some basic, loose ground rules. The two microphones situated in the space served no purpose as their cables lay unplugged on the floor. This phase of the performance included prolonged moments of silence or repeated music meant to bore the audience and raise the awkward tension, potentially encouraging individuals to act without instruction, break the ground rules, and explore the theater beyond the curtain.</p><p><strong>Part 2: Passing Through the Curtain</strong><br>Most audiences refused to move without explicit instruction to do so. After some time, the speakers instructed everyone to pass through the curtains into the main space. This main area was composed of multiple sets littered with broken or malfunctioning technology, as well as numerous speakers scattered throughout. Much of this equipment was ostensibly plugged-in and active, but only a select nineteen speakers actually worked. I included tens of unused speakers, as well other devices such as illuminated soundboards, computer monitors, and TVs.</p><p><strong>Part 3: Shopping for Groceries</strong><br>In the larger theatrical space, the pre-recorded narrator began reading an ingredient list and encouraged the audience to interact with a grocery store-inspired set. Throughout this phase, the voice would give indications that the audienceâs actions were being monitored (which wasnât true). Some audiences laughed, some stayed silent, and some chaotically began dismantling the grocery shelves.</p><p><strong>Part 4: Driving Home</strong><br>The pre-recorded voice then encouraged the audience to mimic a driving experience as if the participants were taking their groceries home. Individuals selected their âcarâ and the aural atmosphere of a road immersed the theater. This soundscape frequently stopped, indicating that an individual was not performing properly and as such the performance theoretically could not continue (which wasn't true).</p><p><strong>Part 5: Reading, Wandering</strong><br>Finally, the instructions led the audience to a library-esque area, but the narration provided little direction at this point. Instead, I wanted to see how participants would interact with the space when given no additional direction. The results varied again from uneventful to chaoticâindividuals sat and did nothing, talked into microphones for no one listening, or destroyed the food from the grocery store. In one performance, a group of people wrapped the grocery shelves entirely with tinfoil. In another, many people gathered on the stage, which was perhaps the only true off-limits zone (as I was sitting operating the show right behind a curtain). Finally, once someone chose to exit the theater, the performance would end. An usher would enter the space to blow an airhorn signifying to all that the show was over.</p>","links":[["Read the research paper, âNo Replica: Aesthetics of the Performative for Automataâ","https://digitalcollections.wesleyan.edu/object/ir-1412"]],"tags":"physical, sound, writing","year":2018,"sort-chrono":"2018-12-06","sort-custom":2,"sort-alpha":"no-replica","thumbnail":{"format":"video","image":"noreplica-thumbnail.jpg","video":"noreplica-thumbnail.mp4","alt":"No Replica"},"assets":[{"format":"embed","image":"noreplica-overview.jpg","html":"<iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/506768971?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&color=f61d5d' frameborder='0' allow='fullscreen; picture-in-picture'></iframe>","alt":"Overview"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-entrance.jpg","alt":"Part 1: sound system"},{"format":"video","image":"noreplica-intros.jpg","video":"noreplica-intros.mp4","alt":"Part 1: seating arrangements"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-intromicrophone.jpg","alt":"Part 1: an audience member intervenes"},{"format":"video","image":"noreplica-emerging.jpg","video":"noreplica-emerging.mp4","alt":"Part 2: passing through the curtain"},{"format":"video","image":"noreplica-blockades.jpg","video":"noreplica-blockades.mp4","alt":"Part 2: tech junk blockades"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-fulltheater.jpg","alt":"Part 2: set design overview"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-grocery.jpg","alt":"Part 3: grocery shelves"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-groceryshelves.jpg","alt":"Part 3: grocery shelves"},{"format":"video","image":"noreplica-shopping.jpg","video":"noreplica-shopping.mp4","alt":"Part 3: scenes from the shopping portion"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-road2.jpg","alt":"Part 4: driving simulation"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-road1.jpg","alt":"Part 4: driving simulation"},{"format":"video","image":"noreplica-driving.jpg","video":"noreplica-driving.mp4","alt":"Part 4: scenes from the driving portion"},{"format":"video","image":"noreplica-sammy.jpg","video":"noreplica-sammy.mp4","alt":"Part 5: audience member approaches the microphone"},{"format":"video","image":"noreplica-ava.jpg","video":"noreplica-ava.mp4","alt":"Part 5: audience member approaches the microphone"},{"format":"video","image":"noreplica-christopher.jpg","video":"noreplica-christopher.mp4","alt":"Part 5: audience member approaches the microphone"},{"format":"video","image":"noreplica-variousclips.jpg","video":"noreplica-variousclips.mp4","alt":"Part 5: various clips"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-dump.jpg","alt":"Behind the scenes: full inventory of tech junk"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-inprogress.jpg","alt":"Behind the scenes: set design in-progress"},{"format":"embed","image":"noreplica-sound-check.jpg","html":"<iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/507634991?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&color=f61d5d' frameborder='0' allow='fullscreen; picture-in-picture'></iframe>","alt":"Behind the scenes: sound check"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-prelimplots.jpg","alt":"Behind the scenes: preliminary stage plot"},{"format":"image","image":"noreplica-poster.jpg","alt":"Show poster"}],"color":"#f61d5d","invert":true,"active":true},"four-years-later":{"key":"four-years-later","title":"Four Years Later","subtitle":"for Payton Millet","tagline":"Poster for an original musical about a post-break-up meeting in a coffee shop.","desc":"<p><em>Four Years Later</em> was an original musical with a book written by Ian Baxley and music composed by Payton Millet.
